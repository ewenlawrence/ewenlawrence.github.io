I am an Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger Quantum fellow in the Atominstitut at TU Wien based in the group of Peter Rabl. Prior to this I was an EPSRC postdoctoral fellow in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews where I collaborated closely with Jonathan Keeling and Brendon Lovett.

My research focuses on developing techniques for understanding complex, many-body, and non-Markovian open quantum systems.
