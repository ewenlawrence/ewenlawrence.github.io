We are a theoretical research group in the field of open quantum systems, at the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, Scotland). Some of the areas we are intrested in are: numerical non-Markovian methods, the open Dicke model, machine learning for calculating ground states, optimal control in open systems.

We are part of the <a href="http://cnqo.phys.strath.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Computational Nonlinear and Quantum Optics group (CNQO)</a> at the University of Strathclyde.
