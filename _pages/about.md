<p>I am an Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger Quantum fellow in the Atominstitut at TU Wien based in the group of <a href="https://ati.tuwien.ac.at//research_areas/quantum_optics_theory/research/EN/" target="_blank">Peter Rabl</a>.
Prior to this I was an EPSRC postdoctoral fellow in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of St Andrews where I collaborated closely with <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmjk/" target="_blank">Jonathan Keeling</a> and <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~bwl4" target="_blank">Brendon Lovett</a>. 
My PhD was with <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~ppxada/" target="_blank">Andrew Armour</a> at the University of Nottingham.</p>

<p>My research focuses on developing techniques for understanding complex, many-body, and non-Markovian open quantum systems. </p>
